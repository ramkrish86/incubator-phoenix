  <!-- Often clients want to use Phoenix in an existing HBase environment (they have 
    their own HBase version already built), so the standard HBase jar shouldn't be included 
    (as with the regular client jar) as it will conflict the installed version. This 
    profile does the same thing as the client.xml build, but excludes the hbase stuff. -->
